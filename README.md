- #333333 (Dark Gray): This color provides a modern and professional look, acting as a neutral and calming base. It ensures good contrast with lighter colors, enhancing readability while giving the app a sophisticated, minimalistic feel.
- #FFFFFF (White): White symbolizes simplicity and cleanliness, creating a bright and open interface. It balances the darker tones, improving visual clarity and making the app feel user-friendly and inviting.
- #E1F4F3 (Soft Aqua): This soft, refreshing color adds a subtle touch of warmth and energy to the interface. It symbolizes trust and innovation, complementing the darker and lighter tones to create a cohesive, elegant, and approachable design.
- #706C61: This muted, earthy tone adds depth and warmth to the overall design, creating a subtle contrast against the darker #333333 and the bright #FFFFFF. Its neutral yet sophisticated appearance evokes stability, reliability, and professionalism. It serves as a grounding element, tying the color palette together and softening the overall visual experience.
This color palette was chosen to achieve a clean, minimalistic, and modern aesthetic, emphasizing usability and professionalism.
