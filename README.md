## Agile Development

User stories were prioritized using MoSCoW.
The Agile process emphasizes incremental development and user-focused delivery. The following flowchart outlines how key application features and workflows, such as user validation, transaction handling, and account management, were prioritized and developed across sprints:<br>

This workflow guided the sprint planning and ensured seamless integration of essential features.

## User Experience(UX)

User Stories were tracked throughout the project as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/users/Tamas-Gavlider/projects/5/views/1).

### User Stories

## Design

### Structure

The ERD represents the database structure for the application.
 - Profile - Stores user-specific details such as balance, notification preferences, and unique sending/receiving addresses. Each profile is linked to a user account via a Foreign Key.
 - Transactions - Tracks all financial activities, including deposits, withdrawals, and transfers between users, with fields for transaction type, status, and amounts.
 - Deleted profile - Maintains a record of deleted user profiles, preserving details like username, email, and deletion date for audit purposes.
 - User questions - Captures questions submitted by users in the FAQ section, including the question text and submission date.

### Colour Scheme

![colour](/docs/screenshots/colout%20palette.png)

- #333333 (Dark Gray): This color provides a modern and professional look, acting as a neutral and calming base. It ensures good contrast with lighter colors, enhancing readability while giving the app a sophisticated, minimalistic feel.
- #FFFFFF (White): White symbolizes simplicity and cleanliness, creating a bright and open interface. It balances the darker tones, improving visual clarity and making the app feel user-friendly and inviting.
- #E1F4F3 (Soft Aqua): This soft, refreshing color adds a subtle touch of warmth and energy to the interface. It symbolizes trust and innovation, complementing the darker and lighter tones to create a cohesive, elegant, and approachable design.
- #706C61: This muted, earthy tone adds depth and warmth to the overall design, creating a subtle contrast against the darker #333333 and the bright #FFFFFF. Its neutral yet sophisticated appearance evokes stability, reliability, and professionalism. It serves as a grounding element, tying the color palette together and softening the overall visual experience.
This color palette was chosen to achieve a clean, minimalistic, and modern aesthetic, emphasizing usability and professionalism.

### Typography

The Nanum Myeongjo font, available via Google Fonts, is a sophisticated serif typeface inspired by traditional Korean calligraphy. The fontâ€™s graceful curves and sharp serifs make it stand out, giving your design a distinctive and memorable quality.

### Testing 

I have used Chrome Developer tool while building the web page and troubleshoot any issues immediately.<br>
The following issues were raised during my mid project meeting with my mentor:

- The private key validation was coded with JavaScript. But it is betterto be done with Python.
- The project kanban board issues were not visible by other users on GitHub. The user story template was connected to other project, so I had to delete and readd the issues with the correct repo.
- Change the sender details transactions details. It should show the name of the sender instead of their sending address. 
- Notify user if changes made on the account.
